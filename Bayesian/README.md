# RatGPS - Bayesian models
This subfolder contains MatLab code to train MLE models and Bayesian models with memory.
 
The `Data` folder contains no data, because data files were too large to be uploaded to GitHub. 
Please see README in the Data folder for instructions where to download the data.

The `Code` folder contains all necessary MatLab scripts. However, to train different models (MLE/Bayes) on different data (1D/2D) you will need to tweak some variables. See the `README` in `Code` folder for details.
